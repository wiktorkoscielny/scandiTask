# Getting Started with the solution

1. I have created a new component inside `./src/components/ProgressBar` [directory](https://github.com/wiktorkoscielny/scandiTask/blob/main/assignment/src/components/ProgressBar/ProgressBar.js).
2. Then I have imported that component inside higher ordered component called `Checkout.component.js` and placed it into render method inside JSX. 
3. Then I passed checkoutStep value accesible from parent's component as props to ProgressBar component. Then I made the graphic layer of the new component dependent on this value.
